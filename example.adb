   -- Test scenario was brought from http://stattrek.com/chi-square-test/independence.aspx
   -- But here, as you can see, a little different kind of calculus.
   --
   -- A public opinion poll surveyed a simple random sample of 1000 voters.
   -- Respondents were classified by gender (male or female) and by voting
   -- preference (Republican, Democrat, or Independent).
   ---

   --                     Republican |  Democrat | Independent
   Data : Test_Data := ( (   200.0,      150.0,       50.0),    -- Male
                         (   250.0,      300.0,       50.0) );  -- Female
begin

   Put (Coefficient (Cramer_V (Data)));

   -- Cramer's coefficient:  0.1272
   -- In this case gender gap is insignificant (voting preferences nearly unrelated with voter's gender).
   --
   -- Informal standards of the Cramer's coeficient:
   -- 1.0 - 0.8  -- Very strongly related.
   -- 0.8 - 0.5  -- Fairly strongly related.
   -- 0.5 - 0.25 -- Fairly weakly related.
   -- Below 0.25 -- Unrelated/nearly unrelated.
